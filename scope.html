						        During the past few decades, Sri Lanka has gotten the increased attention of travelers worldwide as a travel destination. Proving this, Sri Lanka owns several global endorsements as one of the best places to travel during the past few years. Selecting as one of the best places to travel from UAE for the year 2020 [1], CNN travel’s best places to visit in 2020 [2], best warm-weather destination to visit in 2019 by USA Today [3], and best travel destination for the year 2019 by Lonely Planet [4] are some of the proofs for the global praise taken by Sri Lanka as a tourist location. Build tourism as an industry within Sri Lanka caused several factors that could be seen in the country. For example, attractive natural sceneries, having multiple environmental diversities within a small area, cultural diversity, and historical elegance of Sri Lanka can be brought to the table. These factors have been caused Sri Lanka to be famous among international travelers as an attractive travel destination. 
								When considering the recent trends of the travelers mostly travel around Sri Lanka, it can be seen that travelers tend to arrange their trips on their own, not relying on the Tourists guides and agencies. The advancement of technology has been most affected these trends. More advanced mobile networking technologies, satellite and GPS technologies, and many more technical advancements can be taken as examples.
								The Smart Guide mobile application is proposed to service the tourism industry in Sri Lanka with the new technology. The mobile application and the system comes up with following features.

						        With the literature study, it can be seen that existing systems in Sri Lanka that are available to assists travelers are less efficient to meet the requirement of the modern traveling trends. Most of the systems are only providing the list of some travel locations and some details of the locations. It cannot find any system that assists the travelers considering the traveler’s preference or provides a customized service. With the global trends and influence of information technology in the tourism industry, in order to attract a bigger customer base to the Sri Lankan tourism industry, it is obvious that Sri Lanka must go forward with the modern trends in the industry and must facilitate the travelers with the most efficient ways.

						        As it can see that influence of the Artificial Intelligence and other expert systems in the tourism industry, it is more convenient to apply those methodologies in the local systems to provide a delightful service to the international tourist community. In order to align Sri Lankan tourism industry with the emerging trends in the global context, it is important to bring up the technological enhancements into the industry, where the travel service providers are able to provide their services to the travelers efficiently and effectively. When tourists come to travel in Sri Lanka, they must have the ability to approach required services in order to get the best travel experience. By studying the existing systems that are available for the tourism industry, it is proven that there is no existing system or platform in Sri Lanka that provides a customized service to independent travelers which focuses on their individual preferences as well as real-time conditions when it comes to trip planning and guiding. Implementing such a system would address the pain point of the travelers who are willing to plan their trip efficiently and optimistically.

In this case, tourists make sure that they select the most suitable locations on their preference in order to plan their trip. It will bring them the most unforgettable experiences during the trip they go on within the limited period that they have allocated. As the world’s best tourists destination, Sri Lanka must concern with tourists' interests and should provide required solutions for the tourists who travel in Sri Lanka in order to give the best travel experience within the country.

At the same platform travlers could be able to interact with the service providers and connect with the service providers once they require their services. Service providers must get the ability to hear to the travelers when the travelers require their service. Apart from that service providers could be able to get information related to the travelers behaviors in different seasons and different situations then they are able to take the right decision for their business in a certain situation.

Most travelers have to reach a travel agency or a travel guide to get the guidance to manage their trips. As discussed in the literature, according to the current global trends in the tourism industry, travelers more tend to manage their trips on their own, rather than getting assistance from another party. Modern technologies come to the stage in this case, to assist the travelers with various technological features. In order to get aligned with the current global trends in the tourism industry, Sri Lanka needs to come up with a solution that allows the tourists to manage their trips within Sri Lanka on their own. It is obvious that the existing solutions given for the tourism industry in Sri Lanka do not address the requirements in the industry in order to align with the global trends. It is required to come up with a solution to address those requirements which will ultimately aid the tourism industry in Sri Lanka to serve the worldwide travelers to get a better travel experience in Sri Lanka.

						        In accordance with the above discussion, it has been proven the importance of implementing a system to assist the travelers who travel in Sri Lanka, in order to get a better travel experience. In accordance with that, it has been figured out several objectives of the proposed system. The proposed system is developed with the aim of serving the tourism sector in Sri Lanka to align with the recent trends in the global tourism industry by accomplishing the following goals.The proposed system work as an assistant to the travelers by suggesting the most suitable locations for each traveler by analyzing their characteristics and preferences. For this, an Artificial Intelligent model is proposed to develop for the system. In this case, it is not much efficient and too costly to develop an AI model to predict the exact set of locations that the user prefers to travel to. Because there can be found a large number of travel locations that various types of travelers may prefer to travel to. Therefore, the travel locations that could find in Sri Lanka are categorized into various categories and the AI model is trained to predict the user preferred location type or types instead of the exact set of locations. This is allowed the AI model to provide its predictions efficiently and effectively.

								The proposed system work as an assistant to the travelers by suggesting the most suitable transportation method for each traveler by analyzing their characteristics and preferences. For this, an Artificial Intelligent model is proposed to develop for the system. The AI model is trained to predict the user preferred transportation method or methods. In this case, it can be used either Clustering models or Classification models to predict the user preferred transportation methods. As transportation methods will be categorized into the following categories, the AI model is supposed to predict the user preferred transportation methods out of them.

								Apart from creating trip plans by considering the user inputs, the proposed system helps the users with suggesting user-preferred trip types as well. For this, the system analyzes the various user information and comes up with predictions for user preferred trip type/s. Here, an Artificial Intelligent model is proposed to predict the user preferred trip types. We have used Classification models to predict the user preferred trip types.  As trips will be categorized into the following categories, the AI model is supposed to predict the user preferred trip types out of them.

						        Software infrastructure services is been an essential part of software development and implementation in the modern context. With the latest developments in the software development industry, infrastructure services have come up with several facilities and possibilities that improve the service of the software product. Especially, cloud services play an important role in this case. Cloud services reduce the cost of managing and maintaining IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment to run the product, costs can be reduced by using the resources of a cloud computing service provider. Cloud services provide other many services as well such as authentication and build tools. Apart from the cloud services, other important infrastructure services are Google APIs and version control services. Google APIs allow software developers to use usually unreachable services such as Google map and Google places, which make the software products reliable to their users. Version controlling services such as Git are very important in a collaborative software development project to carry out each one’s tasks smoothly.
